Flickr Search
===========

**Flickr Search** is a very simple iOS app built in a few hours which consumes the [Flickr Search API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html).

Main features are:
- Infinite scroll of results based on a `[UICollectionViewController](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIViewController_Class/Reference/Reference.html)`.
- History management of past searches.
